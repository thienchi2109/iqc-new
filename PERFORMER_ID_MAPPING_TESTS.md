# Performer ID Mapping Implementation Test Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the tests and validations for the performer ID mapping implementation that maps the ORM `performerId` field to the database column `performer_id_user_id` without renaming the database column.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ 1. DRIZZLE_SCHEMA_MAP
**File:** `lib/db/schema.ts`
**Change:** Updated performerId mapping to use `performer_id_user_id` column with proper FK constraint and onDelete behavior.
```typescript
performerId: uuid('performer_id_user_id').references(() => users.id, { onDelete: 'set null' }),
```

### ✅ 2. SQL_ENSURE_FK_INDEX  
**File:** `db/sql/2025-09-05_performer_fk_index.sql`
**Purpose:** Ensures FK constraint and index exist on performer_id_user_id column.
**Features:**
- Handles column renaming from existing `performer_id` to `performer_id_user_id`
- Creates FK constraint with ON DELETE SET NULL
- Creates performance index
- Idempotent execution (safe to run multiple times)

### ✅ 3. API_QC_RUNS_POST
**File:** `app/api/qc/runs/route.ts`
**Enhanced with:**
- Role-based performer assignment validation
- Tech users can only create runs for themselves
- Supervisors/admins can override performer (with validation)
- Validates performer exists when overriding

### ✅ 4. API_QC_RUNS_GET_PRETTY
**File:** `app/api/qc/runs/route.ts`
**Verified:** Already properly returns performer_name via join with users table.

### ✅ 5. UI_QUICK_ENTRY_PERFORMER  
**File:** `app/(app)/quick-entry/page.tsx`
**Enhanced with:**
- Role-based performer UI:
  - Tech users: Read-only display of their name
  - Supervisor/Admin users: Dropdown to select any user
- Added users API integration
- Proper state management for performerId

### ✅ 6. API_USERS_ENDPOINT
**File:** `app/api/users/route.ts`
**Created:** New API endpoint for user selection (supervisor/admin only).

### ✅ 7. LJ_TOOLTIP_PERFORMER
**File:** `components/LjTooltip.tsx`
**Created:** Comprehensive tooltip component showing:
- QC run details (value, z-score, timestamp)
- Test information (device, test, level)
- Personnel information (performer, approver)
- Status information (status, auto result)
- Notes and additional details

## Test Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Database Migration Test
```bash
# Run the SQL script to ensure column mapping works
psql -d your_database -f db/sql/2025-09-05_performer_fk_index.sql
```

#### 2. API Testing

**Test POST /api/qc/runs as Tech User:**
```bash
# Should succeed with performerId = session.user.id
# Should fail if trying to override performerId
curl -X POST /api/qc/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "deviceId": "uuid",
    "testId": "uuid", 
    "levelId": "uuid",
    "lotId": "uuid",
    "value": 10.5,
    "unitId": "uuid",
    "methodId": "uuid",
    "performerId": "different-user-id"  // Should be rejected
  }'
```

**Test POST /api/qc/runs as Supervisor:**
```bash
# Should succeed with performerId override
# Should validate that performer exists
curl -X POST /api/qc/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "deviceId": "uuid",
    "testId": "uuid",
    "levelId": "uuid", 
    "lotId": "uuid",
    "value": 10.5,
    "unitId": "uuid",
    "methodId": "uuid",
    "performerId": "another-user-id"  // Should be accepted
  }'
```

**Test GET /api/qc/runs:**
```bash
# Should return performer_name in response
curl /api/qc/runs
# Verify response includes performerName field
```

#### 3. UI Testing

**Quick Entry Form Testing:**

1. **Tech User Login:**
   - Navigate to Quick Entry page
   - Verify "Người thực hiện" field shows user's name as read-only
   - Submit form and verify performerId is set correctly

2. **Supervisor/Admin Login:**
   - Navigate to Quick Entry page  
   - Verify "Người thực hiện" field shows dropdown with user selection
   - Select different user and submit
   - Verify API receives correct performerId

#### 4. Component Testing

**LjTooltip Component:**
```typescript
// Test with sample data
const sampleData = {
  id: 'test-id',
  value: 10.5,
  z: 1.2,
  createdAt: '2025-09-05T10:00:00Z',
  deviceCode: 'DEV001',
  testCode: 'GLU',
  level: 'L1',
  performerName: 'John Doe',
  approverName: 'Jane Smith',
  status: 'accepted',
  autoResult: 'pass',
  notes: 'Test note'
}

// Render component and verify all fields display correctly
<LjTooltip data={sampleData} />
```

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### ✅ No DB Renames
- Column `performer_id_user_id` remains as-is
- SQL script handles migration if needed
- Drizzle schema maps to correct column name

### ✅ Drizzle Exposes performerId  
- Schema correctly maps `performerId` to `performer_id_user_id`
- Includes proper FK constraint with onDelete behavior
- Maintains type safety

### ✅ Role-Based Performer Selection
- Tech users: Read-only, shows their name
- Supervisor/Admin: Dropdown selection with validation
- API enforces role-based restrictions

### ✅ Performer Name Display
- GET /api/qc/runs returns performerName via join
- LjTooltip component displays performer information
- Performance optimized with proper indexing

### ✅ FK and Index Present
- SQL script ensures FK constraint exists
- Performance index on performer_id_user_id column
- Proper referential integrity with users table

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Database:** Column `performer_id_user_id` exists with FK constraint and index
2. **API:** Role-based performer assignment works correctly
3. **UI:** Quick Entry shows appropriate performer selection based on user role
4. **Performance:** Queries are optimized with proper indexing
5. **Data Integrity:** FK constraint ensures valid performer references

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Components follow existing design patterns
- API maintains existing security and validation patterns
