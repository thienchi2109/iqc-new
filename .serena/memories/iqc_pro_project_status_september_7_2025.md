# IQC Pro Project Status - September 7, 2025

## Recent Session Achievements
- **QC Level Bug Fix**: Resolved creation failure due to null vs undefined validation mismatch
- **Error Handling Enhancement**: Improved client-side mutation error reporting to surface server details
- **Validation Framework**: Established pattern for optional field handling across forms

## Current System State

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Authentication System**: NextAuth.js with role-based access (admin, qaqc, supervisor, tech)
2. **Catalog Management**: Devices, Tests, Units, Methods, QC Levels, QC Lots, QC Limits
3. **QC Workflow**: Run entry, validation, Westgard rules evaluation
4. **Quick Entry**: Unified form for efficient QC data input
5. **Levey-Jennings Charts**: Interactive visualization with rule violation indicators
6. **Approval System**: Multi-level approval workflow for QC runs
7. **Reports**: Comprehensive reporting with filtering and export capabilities

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Charts**: Recharts library

### Architecture Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between UI components, business logic hooks, and API layers
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Zod validation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with client-side parsing
- **Form Management**: Standardized form patterns with consistent validation

## Development Standards Established

### Form Field Conventions
- Send `undefined` (not `null`) for empty optional string fields
- Align frontend payloads with backend Zod schema expectations
- Consistent error handling with structured server response parsing

### Code Organization

```

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical QC validation logic
- TypeScript type checking across all modules
- Structured error handling with meaningful user feedback
- Development server validation for rapid feedback cycles

## Next Development Priorities
1. **Form Standardization**: Apply undefined vs null pattern to all catalog forms
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement pagination for large datasets
3. **Advanced Reporting**: Enhanced filtering and export capabilities
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize UI for tablet/mobile use
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live QC monitoring

## Deployment Status
- Development environment fully functional
- Database schema established with seed data
- All core workflows tested and validated
- Ready for staging deployment
