# L-J Chart Color Synchronization Fix - September 2025

## Issue Resolved
Fixed color synchronization issue in Levey-Jennings chart where data points were all appearing blue instead of being colored according to their QC result status.

## Root Cause
Interface mismatch between API response format (camelCase) and component interface (snake_case):
- API returns: `autoResult`, `approvalState`, `createdAt`, `z`
- Component expected: `auto_result`, `approval_state`, `created_at`, `z_score`

## Solution Implemented
1. **Updated QcRun interface** in `components/lj/LeveyJenningsChart.tsx` to support both formats
2. **Fixed CustomDot component** to properly read autoResult field and apply correct colors:
   - Green (#16a34a) for "pass"
   - Orange (#ea580c) for "warn" 
   - Red (#dc2626) for "fail"
   - Blue (#3b82f6) for undefined/default
3. **Updated tooltip rendering** to handle both field formats
4. **Added color legend** below chart explaining what each color represents

## Files Modified
- `components/lj/LeveyJenningsChart.tsx`: Main fix for color synchronization

## Result
- Data points now correctly display colors matching their QC auto_result status
- Tooltip shows consistent color indicators
- Legend explains color meanings
- Chart maintains backward compatibility with both API formats
