# C-Lab IQC Pro - Project Status Update
## Date: September 4, 2025

### 🎉 QC Approval Workflow Implementation - COMPLETED

All tasks for the explicit QC approval workflow have been successfully implemented and deployed. The system is now fully functional with the following components:

#### ✅ Database Layer
- **Schema Updates**: Added approval workflow columns to `qc_runs` table
  - `auto_result` ENUM('pass', 'warn', 'fail')
  - `approval_state` ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected') DEFAULT 'pending'
  - `approved_by` UUID (FK to users)
  - `approved_at` TIMESTAMP
  - `approval_note` TEXT
- **Migration Applied**: Database successfully updated with new columns and indexes
- **Drizzle Schema**: Updated with proper relations and types

#### ✅ Backend Implementation
- **Westgard Engine Patch**: Modified to set `auto_result` without changing `approval_state`
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/qc/runs/[id]/approve` - Approve runs with business rule validation
  - `/api/qc/runs/[id]/reject` - Reject runs with mandatory notes
  - Enhanced `/api/qc/runs` to return approval workflow fields
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (supervisor/qaqc/admin only)
- **Business Rules**: Failed runs require CAPA or subsequent passing runs
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of all approval actions

#### ✅ Frontend Implementation
- **Approval Inbox UI**: Complete page at `/approval-inbox`
  - Real-time filtering and search
  - Batch approval/rejection actions
  - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
  - Vietnamese localization
- **Navigation Integration**: Added "Hộp thư duyệt QC" menu item
- **L-J Chart Enhancement**: 
  - Hollow dots for pending approval
  - Solid dots for approved/rejected
  - Color coding by auto_result (green/yellow/red)
- **UI Components**: Created Badge, Dialog, Table, Textarea components

#### ✅ Configuration & Environment
- **Feature Flag**: `USE_APPROVAL_GATE=true` (configurable)
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback system with sonner
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and Next.js 15 compatibility

### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon integration
- **ORM**: Drizzle with proper relations and indexes
- **Authentication**: NextAuth with role-based permissions
- **UI**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful compilation (19.7kB approval page)

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Westgard engine approval logic
- **API Validation**: Zod schemas for all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

### 📚 Documentation Updates
- **SPEC Updated**: Added approval workflow requirements
- **API Documentation**: Endpoint specifications
- **Database Schema**: Column definitions and relations

### 🚀 Deployment Status
- **Build**: ✅ Successful (npm run build)
- **Database**: ✅ Migration applied
